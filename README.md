# gfz-riesgos-wps-repository

This is the java source code for the wps-repository for the riesgos project.
Processes that are using command line tools and are used in this project by the GFZ 
should be included here.

## Currently implemented processes

### Quakeledger

Quakeledger is the first services provided here. This implementation is
based on the version provided by Benjamin Pro√ü here:

https://github.com/bpross-52n/quakeledger

This is a slightly modified version of the repository here:

https://github.com/GFZ-Centre-for-Early-Warning/quakeledger

The aim of the quakeledger process is to provide earth quake event informations
in a given region (and with some other filtering criterias (depth, magnitude, ...)).

### Shakyground

Like Quakeledger Shakyground is based on a python script you can find here:

https://github.com/GFZ-Centre-for-Early-Warning/shakyground

It takes an QuakeML input file and computes the shake map (this is xml too).

The dockerfile you can find in this repository does not work because of an
error on installing the python gmt library.

## Features

All the processes are using a generic template for working with command line tools.
This includes input via
* stdin
* command line parameter
* input files

For output there are the following options:
* handling of the exit value
* handling of stdout
* handling of stderr
* output files

The processes itself run inside of docker containers.
Example Dockerfiles to create the images necessary for this are included in the
assistence folder.

## Installation

1. Make sure that your WPS Server can run docker

For running executables inside of docker it is necessary that docker is installed
on the WPS Server itself.

If the WPS server itself runs inside of docker than you can edit the dockerfile for 
the server by adding the following lines:

```
RUN apt update 
RUN apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common gnupg2 -y
RUN curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/debian/gpg | apt-key add -
RUN add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/debian $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
RUN apt update 
RUN apt install docker-ce -y
```

Please note that this is the installation process for tomcat:9-jre8 as base image.
This is using a debian stretch distribution. When you use another distribution the 
installation process may change.

If you use docker-compose you must also add a line for adding a volume.
This is used to pass through access to the docker socket:

```
volumes:
    [...]
    - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Then rebuild the image used by docker-compose by 
```
docker-compose build
```

2. Compile the project and create a package

The next step is to create a jar file out of the java code:

```
mvn clean package
```

3. Copy the jar to the WEB-INF/lib folder of the server

The created jar must be copied to the WEB-INF/lib folder of the server.

4. Check dependencies

A - maybe - new dependencies that must be included is the jar for Apache Commons Compress.
In the repository here the version 1.9 is used.

Please check if the commons-compress-1.9.jar file is found in the WEB-INF/lib folder
of the server.

If you don't find the jar in that folder you may find it in the 
```
~/.m2/repository/org/apache/commons/commons-compress/1.9/
```
folder. This is the folder used by maven for storing downloaded jar files in an 
Ubuntu 18.10 distribution.
The name of the folder may differ on your system.

Addionally the jar for org.apache.ant and the version 1.10.5 must be provided.
Once you build the new version of this repository you can find the jar in the
m2 repository folder as well.

5. Edit the WEB-INF/classes/dispatcher-servlet.xml file in the 52n-wps-webap-[...] folder

Same as the in the https://github.com/riesgos/52north-wps-osmtovector-process repository
the WEB-INF/classes/dispatcher-servlet.xml file must be edited.

Change the line
```
<context:component-scan base-package="org.n52.wps">
```

into 
```
<context:component-scan base-package="org.n52">
```

This is necessary for the server that it searches for repostoties that are not
part of the org.n52.wps package.

6. Create the docker image for the processes

You must create the docker images for each process you want to use.
At the moment there is only the Quakeledger process.

If you run the WPS Server on a decicated server you must build them on that server.
If you run the WPS Server in docker than it is easily possible to build the images
on the host system (because of sharing the same docker demon).

Go into the assistance/dockerfile/quakeledger folder and run
```
docker build .
```

This command needs some time to run.

You need to save the image id for later use.

You can extract it right after the creation by running

```
docker images | head
```

It should be the most recent one.

7. Configure the process

Now it is time to start/restart the WPS server.

Once the server is ready you can go to to the configuration board of the server.
If the server runs inside of docker you may access it via

```
localhost:8080/wps
```

Under Repositories you find the GFZ RIESGOS Configuration Module.
There is a text field for inserting a JSON-Configuration.

After the imageId may change when build on another system, you have to edit this
configuration.

Insert the following:

```$xslt
[{"title": "Quakeledger", "imageId", "<INSERT_YOUR_IMAGE_ID_HERE>"}]
```

After a click on save you should be able to run the Quakeledger process.

## Configuration

While it is the aim to provide a flexible approach to insert your own services,
the configuration options in the moment are very sparsely.

It is an ongoing work to improve the situation.


## Supported types

At the moment there are the possibilities to provide double and string
command line arguments and to read xml files in after the exection of a
command line program.

(This are only the types needed to implement Quakeledger and Shakyground).

Here is some work necessary too.

## Known problems with docker

Using docker means that there is an overhead in the whole execution process.
A container for each run must be created before and removed after the execution.
For all input and output files there must be communication with the underlying
docker file system. So also temporary files that are already on the server must be
copied to the container.

The overhead may course longer runtimes - and may also course timeouts on 
clientside.

Another problem is that the image id differ when created on different machines.
The reason for that is that in most docker build processes there is a kind
of update for a linux package manager. Executed on different machines and in a 
different time forces differences in the files of the system. That means that
the checksums of the layers of the docker build process will differ.


Also the whole process of the installation is much more complicated.

However the use of docker gives some advantages:

* All the process executions are seperated. There is no way that they may influence
each other.
* All temporary files created by the command line executable are removed 
after the execution by removing the docker container.
* Docker seperates the dependencies of the command line programs. Each process has
its own Dockerfile, which specifies the dependencies for this single process.
So it is possible to run several services that uses conflicting libraries.
* It is possible to test the execution of a program inside of docker
but outside of the WPS server. Because of docker, running the image will
make sure that the execution will work - even on a different server.

At the moment there is no final decision on running the services in docker or not.
